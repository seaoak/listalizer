# Listalizer

A *tricky* Twitter client inspired by [Tween](https://sites.google.com/site/tweentwitterclient/).

Listalizer is developed to stand against BAN of the official 3rd-party API.

*I hope Twitter will continue to work together with 3rd-party clients.*

## Features

- Compact list-type view (how many tweets you can view at a glance).
- Leverage right-click operation (over browser's default menu).
- Make configuration easier by using custom CSS.

## Development policies

- Just fox, but *don't be evil*.
- Keep itself hidden from Twitter.
- Never censor by default (adding user options is acceptable).

## Future works

- Extract tweets which were posted by a specified user, not include retweets (just watch their own tweets).
- Support multiple accounts.
- Support multiple services (such as Mastdon).
- Migrate to Tauri (Rust + WebView).
