# Listalizer

A *tricky* Twitter client inspired by [Tween](https://sites.google.com/site/tweentwitterclient/).

Listalizer is developed to stand against BAN of the official 3rd-party API.

*I hope Twitter will continue to work together with 3rd-party clients.*

## Future works

* Display tweets which were posted by a specified user, not include RT.
